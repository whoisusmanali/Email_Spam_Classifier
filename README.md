# Email Spam Classifier

A comprehensive project for detecting spam emails using advanced machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

This project involves building an Email Spam Classifier that accurately identifies and filters spam emails. The classifier utilizes various machine learning and deep learning models, along with sophisticated text preprocessing and feature engineering methods, to achieve high accuracy.

## Project Timeline

**Jan 2023 - Jun 2023**

## Key Features

- **Advanced Text Preprocessing:** Implemented techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal to enhance feature extraction.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve spam detection accuracy.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Applied sentiment analysis to identify potentially harmful or phishing emails.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved a high accuracy rate (e.g., 95%+) through cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods.
- **User Interface:** Created an intuitive UI for monitoring and managing spam detection, with detailed reports and visualizations.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository link]
    cd email-spam-classifier
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the preprocessing script:**

    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

4. **Train the models:**

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

5. **Run the classifier:**

    ```bash
    python classify.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocessing:** Use `preprocess.py` to clean and preprocess the email data.
2. **Training:** Use `train.py` to train the machine learning and deep learning models.
3. **Classification:** Use `classify.py` to classify new emails as spam or not spam.
4. **UI:** Launch the user interface to monitor and manage spam detection.

## Results

- **Accuracy:** The classifier achieved a high accuracy rate (e.g., 95%+) in identifying spam emails.
- **Performance:** Reduced false positive and false negative rates significantly through model refinement and extensive testing.
